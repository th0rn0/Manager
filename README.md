### Docker-compose

This method is intended to be run with docker-compose. It will create a full stack including database, load balancer & SSL Encryption.

#### Post-Docker

When running for the first time you'll be a new APP_KEY will be generated. Keep this safe!. You'll need to add it to the env variables (EG ```-e APP_KEY=someRandomKey```) otherwise it will regenerate the APP_KEY on each reboot.

Once running and the database has migrated go to your app and you will be greated with the install page

### Makefile

This method is intended for development but can be used in production. It uses docker-compose to build the image and database from the source code instead of pulling them from docker hub.

#### 1. Setup & Configuration

Run ```make env-file``` to create a ```.env``` file in the ```src```  directory. Then modify it as according to your preferences. KEEP THIS SAFE & SECURE! This file holds the credentials used within the app. If any would be hacker was to get hold of this file they have access to everything! 

#### 2. Run

Run the stack detached. This is re attachable. 

```
make
```

##### Interactive

Run the stack in the foreground. Once exited the stack will stop.

```
make interactive
```

##### Migrate & Seed Database

Run Database migrations and populate.

```
make database-migrate
make database-seed
```

#### Stop

Stop the stack.

```
make stop
```

## HTTPS

To enable HTTPS set ```ENABLE_HTTPS=true```. If you wish to use your own certs, copy them to ```resources/certs``` or mount in the certs to the ```/etc/nginx/certs``` directory on the container. 

Note: Only set HTTPS to true if you are doing SSL Termination within the app.

### Caveats

- You must rename the certs to ```eventula_manager.crt``` and ```eventula_manager.key```.

## Secret Managers

The Event Manager ships with a file reader for Env variables such as Passwords as API Keys for Secrets Managers such as Ranchers Secret Manager, EnvKey and Summon. To use it append ```_FILE``` to the Env variable and change the value to be the location of the secret file located on the container! It is recommended you mount a secrets directory into the container for example:

If we add the volume; ```resources/secrets/:/run/secrets``` and store our ```DB_PASSWORD``` in a file called ```DB_PASSWORD``` in ```resources/secrets/``` directory, we can set ```DB_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/DB_PASSWORD``` and the app will read the file and inject the password into the Environment Variable ```DB_PASSWORD```.

### Caveats

- Only one entry per file
- File must only container value
- The file can be named anything, but it must be reflected in the ```_FILE``` env variable
- It will only work on the following Env Variables;
  - FACEBOOK_APP_ID
  - FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET
  - FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID
  - DB_DATABASE
  - DB_USERNAME
  - DB_PASSWORD
  - MYSQL_DATABASE
  - MYSQL_USER
  - MYSQL_PASSWORD
  - ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID
  - PAYPAL_USERNAME
  - PAYPAL_PASSWORD
  - PAYPAL_SIGNATURE
  - STEAM_API_KEY
  - CHALLONGE_API_KEY
  - APP_KEY

## Custom SCSS & Views

To load in custom SCSS (Sassy CSS) & Views (Blade) mount the following directories;

- ```path_to_scss:/web/html/resources/assets/sass```
- ```path_to_views:/web/html/resources/assets/views```

CSS must be in SCSS format.

To recompile CSS use the 'Recompile CSS' link located at http://localhost/admin/appearance

You can also change base variables and ad your own in the appearance page.
